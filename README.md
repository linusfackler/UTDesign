# TutorGuide

## Abstract
Our project aims to develop a state-of-the-art full-stack website that offers an innovative tutor-student connection program. Our platform will provide students with a user-friendly interface, allowing them to easily register, search for qualified tutors based on their subject needs, and create meetings with them. The platform will also allow students to track their meetings' duration and other pertinent details.

To achieve our goals, we will leverage the power of the Mongo DB database and the React Framework to create a modern and comprehensive interface. Our focus on modern design principles, work-load management, and team communication/involvement will allow us to gain valuable experience in team project design. By working collaboratively, we aim to develop a platform that caters to students' diverse academic needs while providing an engaging and personalized learning experience.

## Introduction
Education has always been an essential part of society, and with the advancement of technology, the way we learn has been evolving rapidly. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the education industry has faced a significant disruption, with a vast number of students being forced to switch to remote learning. In response to this challenge, we propose the development of an online tutoring platform that will provide students with a personalized and interactive learning experience.

The objective of this project is to create an online tutoring platform that can bridge the gap between traditional classroom learning and remote education. Our platform will provide students with a user-friendly interface, allowing them to easily connect with qualified tutors in various subjects.

Several similar solutions exist in the market; however, we plan to differentiate ourselves by offering a more personalized approach. Our platform will utilize modern web development technologies to provide an immersive and interactive learning experience, with a range of tools and features to enhance the learning process. We will be focusing on affordability, accessibility, and quality to cater to students of all ages and academic levels.

We plan to solve the problem of inadequate personalized support and guidance in remote learning by offering a more customized learning experience to our students. We expect that our platform will enhance the current solutions available in the market, and we aim to provide a unique solution that is more student-centric. Our goal is to make quality education accessible to all, and we believe that our platform will revolutionize the online learning landscape.

## Impact and Security
There are a number of different security concerns that could potentially come up with administering an online tutoring site. For one, there are the issues of authentication and authorization. It is critical that we ensure that only authorized users can access the website and its features, and that student and tutor data is protected from unauthorized access. Another thing from this is that we are running a database with the information of all our users, including their passwords which can be considered critical when it comes to privacy. To protect this information, we have decided to save passwords as a hash with private encryption. It is important that if someone uses this website, that they know that their information is protected.

The impact of an online tutoring website on education can be significant. Online tutoring allows students to receive personalized instruction and support from qualified tutors at any time and from any location. This can be particularly beneficial for students who live in remote areas or who have limited access to traditional tutoring services. This is something we all learned through our time during the pandemic when most universities went online. Additionally, online tutoring can help to bridge the gap in academic achievement between students from different socio-economic backgrounds, by providing affordable and accessible tutoring services.  We feel like we have offered a great service to the field of education with our project.
